# testing-exercises
This repo is meant to hold test exercises that will bolster your testing skills in the wake of the QA apocalypse. 

For now there's only one thing to test and that's the submitLead module. So create `submitLead.test.js` and try to get 100% code coverage.
Solutions coming soon....
